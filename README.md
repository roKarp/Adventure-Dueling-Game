# Adventure-Game
Short explanation

This game can be run in for example Ubuntu by running the ./game command in this folder. I already compiled the project.c file in to a file that can be just simply run.

Here is what you can do:
A: Type "A {Character name} {HP} {Weapon name} {ATK}" to create a character for the game
L: To print the created characters
H: Type "H {Attackers name} {Defenders name}" to run an attack. The attacker and defender need to have been created for the attack to be successful.
W: Type "W {filename}" to save the current characters for a file that is located in the same place as this game
O: Type "O {filename}" to load a saved character file.
Q: to exit the game

I don't think the game has any big errors but I might have missed something.
