# Adventure-Game
Short explanation

This game can be run in for example Ubuntu by first compiling the projekti.c file. To do this you can use a program like gcc to compile it.

The basic tutorial for this is that you type "gcc projekti.c -o {exectutable program name}" in the downloaded repository. This creates a compiled file that can be simply run by typing "./{compiled code filename}" in the folder that contains the compiler. 

Here is what you can do in this game:

  A: Type "A {Character name} {HP} {Weapon name} {ATK}" to create a character for the game.

  L: To print the created characters.

  H: Type "H {Attackers name} {Defenders name}" to run an attack. The attacker and defender need to have been created for the attack to be successful.
  
  W: Type "W {filename}" to save the current characters for a file that is located in the same place as this game.
  
  O: Type "O {filename}" to load a saved character file.
  
  Q: to exit the game.

I don't think the game has any big errors but I might have missed something.
